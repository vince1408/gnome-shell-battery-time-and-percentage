# Battery Time and Percentage <img src="panel.png" align="right" alt="icon">

A GNOME shell extension to show the remaining time until fully charged/discharged as well as battery charge in percent in the panel.

This is a fork of the excellent https://github.com/mzur/gnome-shell-batime.

If you want just the battery percentage, gnome shell already can do that by itself. Run this on a terminal:
```
 gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface show-battery-percentage true
```

If you want just the battery time, use the original extension, [Battery Time](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1475/battery-time/)
